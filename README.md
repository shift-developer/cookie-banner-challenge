# Wibson-Challenge

## 🎯 Goal
Create a web App that allows the user to insert a customizable banner on their site.

## 📝 Description

We are going to create a cookie banner that can be put on any website with a single line of code, but without implementing the logic of scanning, categorizing, blocking and accepting cookies. That is, we are only going to create its UI.
The application consists of three mobile parts: the frontend with which the user will be able to customize the banner, the banner and the backend that serves all this.
